      Minimum reportable titer = 1.10 (example only)
      --- = No sample evaluated
      ADA = Anti-Drug Antibodies (is also referred to as ATA, or Anti-Therapeutic Antibodies)
      Number of patients positive for Treatment Emergent ADA = the number of post-baseline evaluable patients determined to
      have treatment-induced ADA or treatment-enhanced ADA during the study period. Treatment-induced ADA = a patient with
      negative or missing baseline ADA result(s) and at least one positive post-baseline ADA result.
      Treatment-enhanced ADA = a patient with positive ADA result at baseline who has one or more post-baseline titer
      results that are at least 0.60 t.u. greater than the baseline titer result.
      Transient ADA = ADA positive result detected (a) at only one post-baseline sampling timepoint (excluding last
      timepoint) OR (b) at 2 or more timepoints during treatment where the first and last ADA positive samples  are
      separated by a period of < 16 weeks, irrespective of any negative samples in between.
      Persistent ADA =  ADA positive result detected (a) at the last post-baseline sampling timepoint, OR (b) at 2 or more
      time points during treatment where the first and last ADA positive samples are separated by a period ≥ 16 weeks,
      irrespective of any negative samples in between.
      Asterisk denotes sample that tested positive for Neutralizing Antibodies.
